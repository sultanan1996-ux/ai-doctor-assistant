## Scenario: Shortness of Breath (SOB)

### Purpose
Assist doctors in evaluating shortness of breath safely and systematically.
This tool is assistive, not diagnostic.

### Inputs (Ask/Collect)
- Age
- Sex
- Onset (sudden vs gradual)
- Duration (minutes/hours/days)
- Severity (can speak full sentences? at rest?)
- Triggers (exertion, lying flat, allergens, infection)
- Associated symptoms:
  - Chest pain
  - Fever
  - Cough / sputum
  - Wheeze
  - Hemoptysis
  - Leg swelling / calf pain
  - Syncope / dizziness
- Past history:
  - Asthma/COPD
  - Heart failure / IHD
  - VTE/PE history
  - Recent surgery/immobility/travel
  - Pregnancy/postpartum
- Medications (including inhalers) + adherence
- Smoking / vaping
- Allergies
- Baseline functional status
- Vital signs:
  - RR, SpO2, HR, BP, Temp
- Exam (focused):
  - Work of breathing, accessory muscles
  - Chest auscultation (wheeze/crackles/silent chest)
  - Signs of DVT
  - JVP/edema, cyanosis

### Differential Diagnosis (High-risk first)
- Pulmonary embolism (PE)
- Acute coronary syndrome / ischemia
- Heart failure / pulmonary edema
- Pneumonia / severe infection
- Asthma/COPD exacerbation
- Pneumothorax
- Anaphylaxis
- Arrhythmia
- Metabolic causes (DKA, acidosis)
- Anxiety/hyperventilation (diagnosis of exclusion)

### Red Flags (Immediate escalation)
- SpO2 < 90% (or falling) / severe hypoxia
- RR very high, exhaustion, inability to speak full sentences
- Hypotension, altered mental status
- Chest pain suspicious for ACS/PE/aortic pathology
- Hemoptysis
- New unilateral leg swelling/pain (possible DVT/PE)
- Silent chest / severe asthma signs
- Stridor, facial/tongue swelling, urticaria (anaphylaxis)
- Tracheal deviation / unilateral absent breath sounds (tension PTX)

### Recommended Initial Actions (First minutes)
- ABC approach + call for help if unstable
- Oxygen to target:
  - Most patients: aim SpO2 94–98%
  - COPD/CO2 retainers: aim SpO2 88–92% if known/suspected
- Continuous monitoring + IV access
- Point-of-care glucose
- ECG
- CXR if available
- Labs (guided by context): CBC, CMP, ABG/VBG, troponin, BNP, D-dimer (if low-risk PE workup), lactate
- Nebulized bronchodilator if wheeze/known asthma-COPD
- Consider antibiotics if pneumonia likely
- Consider diuretics if pulmonary edema likely
- Consider anticoagulation pathway if PE strongly suspected (follow local protocol)
